    <h1>What is a Model Kit?</h1>

    According to Wikipedia, a model kit is "a plastic scale model manufactured as a kit, primarily assembled by hobbyists, and intended for static display." 
    Traditional model kits are generally large mechanical objects like cars or airplanes. 
    Traditional kits are assembled with glue and sometimes require paint.

    <h2>What type of Model Kits do I enjoy?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
    My personal preference involves the more modern day interpretations of model kits, 
    a company called Gunpla makes exceptionally cheap and easy to put together kits of popular science fiction robots.
    The number one reason I prefer them is due to their relatively cheap cost compared to other building kits like Legos.
    I am a big fan of science fiction, and a big lego fan, so the concept of model kits is a perfect match for me as a person.

    <h2>What does the assembly process look like?</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
    What sets apart Gunpla model kits from traditional model kits is the lack of glue and prepainted plastic pieces. 
    Instead of glue, everything snaps together neatly for assembly. The kits are injection molded into these plastic sheets that are easy to
    take apart and assemble together. While it is a few more steps then opening a bag of Legos, the snipping apart of each piece individually is quite
    theraputic.

    <h2>Modifications of Gunpla Kits</h4>
    <p>
    Another fantastic perk of the design philosophy of Gunpla is that you can take an individual kit as far as your artistic limits can handle.
    There are countless modifications you can do, weathering, painting, or even creating new parts with something like a 3D printer.
